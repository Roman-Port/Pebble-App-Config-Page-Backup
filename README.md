# Pebble App Config Page Archive
Since app config pages are self hosted by developers of apps, some will inevitably disappear off of the internet some day. Here's an archive of all Pebble app config pages as of 1-28-2019.

## Reading
Data on each app and it's config pages are in output.json. You must generate output.json by appending all of the chunks together. This file was split because it was larger than the maximum file size allowed on GitHub. Other files are split into folders by their hostname.

See:

  * process_json.py to process json data (and create index.txt and potentially 357Mb pretty_catalog.json)
  * [index.txt](index.txt) for appid to URL mapping

## Notes

  * Files (only) ~494Mb
  * Git checkout (including history and files) ~565Mb
