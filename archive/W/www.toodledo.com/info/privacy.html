We may also collect Tracking Data when you use our website or mobile application, or when you click on one of our advertisements (including those shown on third party websites).</p>
<p>Third parties or publicly available sources. We may receive personal data about you from various types of third parties, including:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Technical Data and/or Tracking Data from analytics providers, advertising networks and search information providers.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Sharing Your Information</h2>
<ul>
   <li>Companies that help us to provide our services, such as hosting service providers and payment service providers;</li>
   <li>Professional service providers, such as auditors bankers, lawyers, accountants and insurers, marketing agencies, advertising partners and website hosts, who help us run our business; and</li>
   <li>Governments, regulators, law enforcement and fraud prevention agencies, so we can assist law enforcement and comply with law enforcement; and</li>
   <li>Companies approved by you, such as social media sites (if you choose to link your accounts to our website or mobile application).</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, we share personal data with the following specific third parties:</p>
<ul>

   <li>CampaignMonitor for assisting us with our marketing campaigns. Please visit their Privacy Policy to see how they use your personal data.</li>
   <li>Stripe and PayPal for processing payments. Please visit their Privacy Policy to see how they use your personal data.</li>
</ul>

<p>We may share data with third parties to whom we choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law.

<h2>Payment Information</h2>
<p>Toodledo uses third-party payment processors Stripe and PayPal to process payments. All online payments are conducted in accordance with Payment Card Industry (PCI) data security standards and your billing information is encrypted before being communicated to them. Subject to the below exceptions, your credit card details are communicated directly from your browser to these payment processors - Toodledo does not see your full Permanent Account Number (PAN).</p>
<h2>Advertising, Marketing and Your Communication Preferences</h2>
<p>We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Tracking, Usage and Profile Data to form a picture of what we think may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you and tell you about them. This is what we call direct marketing. We carry out direct marketing by email. You have the right at any time to opt out of marketing emails. The easiest way to opt out is to use the unsubscribe link that you will find at the bottom of each communication. </p>
<p>If you see Toodledo’s advertisements on websites and in social media, these may not be directed specifically at you, we might just have bid for the space. But we may specifically direct certain email promotions to you.</p>
<p>We also work with partners to try and promote the reach of our advertisements and use analytics and retargeting for this reason. We use Tracking Data to deliver relevant online advertising, including via websites and social media. For more information on Tracking Data, and in particular cookies, which also help us deliver website and social advertising that we believe is most relevant to you and to potential new customers of Toodledo, please see Cookies below.</p>
<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>You can see from Advertising, Marketing and Your Communication Preferences above that cookies are a tool that we – and everyone one else who operates online – use for advertising. However, advertising is just one of the many reasons why cookies are used, and as you can see below, there are different types of cookies. </p>
<b>Strictly Functional Cookies
</b>
<p>First and foremost, cookies help our websites work better. They help us work behind the scenes to make your customer experience a lot easier. You’d miss a lot of these things if they were gone – like easily logging in and moving from page to page.</p>
<b>Performance Cookies
</b>
<p>Other cookies collect information about how visitors use our websites, and measure how well the websites work – like whether a visitor gets an error message from our web pages. These cookies don't collect information that identifies a visitor. All of the information that these types of cookies collect is aggregated and used to improve how our websites works.</p>
<b>Advertising Cookies
</b>
<p>And of course, there are cookies that collect information about your browsing habits in order to make any advertising that is delivered to you more relevant to you and your interests. They are usually placed by advertising networks with our permission. They remember that you have visited a website and this information is then shared with other organizations such as advertisers. Quite often, targeting or advertising cookies will be linked to site functionality provided by the other organization. This is also why when you’ve been on one of our websites, you might see some tools that you previously looked at on our websites. This includes retargeting.
</p>
<p>Cookies can also tell us if you have seen a specific advertisement, and how long it has been since you have seen it. This is helpful, because it means we can control the effectiveness of our advertisements and control the number of times people might be shown our advertisements. Cookies also help us understand if you’ve opened a marketing email - we don’t want to send you things that you don’t read.</p>
<p>Almost all the cookies that relate to advertising are part of third party online advertising networks. If you’d like to read about how you can control which advertisements you see online, see opt-out programs established by the Digital Advertising Alliance (United States), the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada and the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance. We do not control cookies which are set by advertising networks.</p>
<p>You can also set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set or access cookies. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this website may become inaccessible or not function properly.</p>
<p>For more information about the cookies we use, including who they belong to, their ID and why they are used, <a href="https://www.toodledo.com/info/cookies.php">click here</a>. We’ve also included links to the third-party websites where you can go to find out more.</p>
<h2>Third Party Links</h2>
<p>The website and mobile application may provide links to other websites or resources, including apps developed by third parties using the Toodledo API that may integrate with our website and mobile application, over which Toodledo does not have control (“External Websites”). Such links do not constitute an endorsement by Toodledo of those External Websites, and Toodledo is providing these links to you only as a convenience. We are not responsible for the content of those External Websites, and your use of External Websites is subject to their respective terms of use and privacy policies.</p>
<h2>Data Security & Retention</h2>
<p>We have put in place appropriate security measures designed to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered or disclosed. For example, we use encryption and password protection.  In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know.</p>
<p>We will only keep your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which we collected it in the first place, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.  If you cease using our website and mobile application for one (1) year, we will generally delete your data at that one (1) year anniversary from when you ceased use.</p>
<p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>
<p>We generally keep certain information about our customers (such as, Contact, Identity, Financial and Transaction Data) related to our customers' purchases for seven years after a transaction for tax purposes.</p>
<p>In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data; see Your Legal Rights below for further information.</p>
<h2>International Transfers</h2>
<p>The information you enter on the website or mobile application or otherwise provide to Toodledo may be transferred and processed outside of the European Economic Area to the United States of America, which does not offer an equivalent level of protection to that of the European Union. The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) allows for transfer of personal data from the European Union to a third country in certain situations. By agreeing to the Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy, you agree to the transfer of all such information to the United States of America and to the processing of that information by Toodledo on servers located in the United States of America as described in this Privacy Policy. We may adopt other means, such as entering into different certification programs such as the Privacy Shield under applicable law, in order to ensure adequate safeguards under the GDPR. </p>
<h2>Your Legal Rights</h2>
<p>If the GDPR applies to you because you are in the European Economic Area, you have certain rights in relation to your personal data:</p>
<ul>
   <li>The right to be informed – that’s an obligation on us to inform you how we use your personal data (and that’s what we’re doing in this Privacy Policy);</li>
   <li>The right of access – that’s a right to make what’s known as a ‘data subject access request’ for a copy of the personal data we hold about you;</li>
   <li>The right to rectification – that’s a right to make us correct personal data about you that may be incomplete or inaccurate (though we generally recommend first making any changes in your Account Settings);</li>
   <li>The right to erasure (also known as the ‘right to be forgotten’) – that’s where in certain circumstances you can ask us to delete the personal data we have about you (unless there’s an overriding legal reason we need to keep it);</li>
   <li>The right to restrict processing – that’s a right for you in certain circumstances to ask us to suspend processing personal data;</li>
   <li>The right to data portability – that’s a right for you to ask us for a copy of your personal data in a common format (for example, a .csv file);</li>
   <li>The right to object – that’s a right for you to object to us processing your personal data (for example, if you object to us processing your data for direct marketing); and</li>
   <li>Rights in relation to automated decision making and profiling – that’s a right you have for us to be transparent about any profiling we do, or any automated decision making.</li>
</ul>
<p>These rights are subject to certain rules around when you can exercise them. If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us (see How to Contact Toodledo About Privacy).</p>
<p>Generally, you will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights) unless your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>
<p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. </p>
<p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>
<p>We have appointed a data privacy manager who is responsible for overseeing questions in relation to this Privacy Policy. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, including any requests to exercise your legal rights, please contact the data privacy manager using the details in How to Contact Toodledo About Privacy below.</p>
<p>Finally, you have the right to make a complaint at any time to the supervisory authority for data protection issues in your country of residence. We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the supervisory authority so please contact us first.</p>

<h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>Toodledo may need to update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If so, Toodledo will post its updated Privacy Policy on our websites along with a change notice on the websites. If we make significant changes, we may also send registered users of our services a notice that this Privacy Policy has been changed. Toodledo encourages you to review this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes. Your continued use of this website, mobile application and/or services and/or your continued provision of personal data to us after the posting of such notice will be subject to the terms of the then-current Privacy Policy.</p>
